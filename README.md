# reading-crafting-interpreters

Ever since I saw [Robert Nystrom's Show HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13406081) about his ["Crafting Interpreters" book](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), I've been eagerly waiting to buy and pore over it, even though he has generously made the book free to read online.

As of April 2019, according to his [table of contents](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) -- Nystrom has finished his 22nd chapter ([Local Variables](https://craftinginterpreters.com/local-variables.html)). I've been blown away by the book's presentation and quality of writing since Nystrom shared it 2 years ago, so I thought I could start reading through now, try to follow the code exercises, and buy the thing when it comes out.

This repo is likely going to be mostly random Markdown files with some scattered code. According to the book's introduction, Nystrom intends to show the reader how to write two interpreters -- [the first in Java](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html#the-first-interpreter), the [second in C](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html#the-second-interpreter). I learned those languages years ago in school and don't have much motivation or capacity to relearn them. But maybe I'll try to follow the code writeups in Python and Ruby. I've always been fascinated with the design and concept of languages and parsing, and have a vague feeling that learning how to create them could be not just intellectually interesting, but helpful in my day-to-day work.
